# Note: It's generally not recommended to uninstall packages using pip in prerm scripts,

# Depends field of the control file and let dpkg handle the installation/removal.
# However, if absolutely necessary, you can add the following lines, but use them with caution.
# sudo pip uninstall pycryptodome || true
# sudo pip uninstall crcmod || true
